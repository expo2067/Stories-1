;; The following is a dialog between abductee ID-77-8a-301
;; (known unofficialy as "Albert") and ZR-operative 44-LAMESH-(nolo)
;; (also indexed variously as "Admiral Telos", "Qantuum" and
;; "An ambiguous refutation").
;;
;; The ZR-operative is attempting 
;; to explain the intricate, multiple threats to the local
;; cosmic harmony posed by the HAARP project.
;; 
;; A standard mnemeo-vibratic interpretive agent has been used
;; to produce the attached annotated trace of the incident.
;; 
;; Even though the human neurology in question had been upgraded
;; to enhanced z-association protocols (MILSPEC-Sunflower 2.0 spec),
;; it remains unclear as to whether the abductee
;; really "understood" what he was being told.


;; STEP 1: the ZR-operative establishes the subject and purpose
;; of the discussion.
