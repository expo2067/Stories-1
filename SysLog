<ABSTRACT>
	Trans-liminal correlation in osteogonic simulations has hitherto
been found to be woefully imprecise. Mothman trans-correlation is obviously
reaching its limits. A novel ideo-teslaic effect is proposed. Narrative
closure is corroborated by several indepent OTTER-api extensions
that are Soltec-compliant. [delegates with Virgo clearance, go here...]
A countably-infinite propositional tessalation is coerced over all
local manifolds. Is consistency abandoned? The 5-correlative (5-corr)
grammar construction, nonethless, continues to elude Soltec-compliant
modelling.

The Honourable Soron will extrapolate from known axiomatic-
schemata frameworks; a simulacrum of VonNeumann himself will
be demonstrated, and refuted! A symbiont of the Face on Mars
is proposed: are we hearing the resonant pre-echoes of the future?
