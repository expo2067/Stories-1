*08:55 am ET*: ...PARC Concept Exchange futures are -35.70 which is 
roughly in line with fair value, suggesting a relatively strong start 
when trading begins...

*09:15 ET*: ...Government psychometric data released this morning is 
decidedly mixed. Adjusted Neural Membrane Usage is up a 
surprising +5.4%, the Semeo-Singularity Index is a reassuring 
+1.2%, and Consumer Constraint Satisfaction is up 3.5% (handily 
beating analysts' most optimistic whisper numbers) but the month-
to-month Anamolous Influx Classification Count is an unsettling -
0.7% (most observers had been expecting at least a workable 
+0.5%), ProNeural licensing revenue on all the FCC-approved 
CONCEPT Channels is down almost 6%, and discourse-invariant 
Co-referential Orgasms on RimTel-hosted sex channels declined a 
whopping 3.2%. Markets could be on the defensive, as investors 
may remain unconvinced that the present "unprecedented" 
economic climate can really sustain itself.

*09:24 ET* ... Remember that Series Eleven options on SUS transfer-
patents are due to expire today. Expect to see greatly added market 
volatility. The markets are likely to move quickly on any news 
(rumors) that might emerge. Momentum plays could include 
legacy NASA space-probe data-miners, teslaic plasma researchers, 
business-to-business automated theorem provers, cascading 
clickstream assemblers, and genome remediators (all of whom 
have been benefitting lately from the recent round of newly-
introduced SUS technologies, as approved by the Soron 
Delegation)...

...JPL is gapping down 73 points, or 43%. Recent law-suits 
plaguing the privatized space-probe organization just got nastier 
with the surprise announcement of the decryption of internal 
memos that JPL lawyers claimed last week to have been 
`irretrievably deleted from a disused server'. The extensive and 
very sensitive files, posted anonymously earlier today on the 
CNBS website, show a systemic pattern of incompetence and 
neglect, "reaching to the highest government agencies", which 
contributed to the string of recent mission disasters, including the 
Europa ocean-ecosystem infection debacle. The data, supposedly 
"absolutely secure" because it was originally stored using RimTel 
quantum spin-state encryption procedures, was apparently 
decrypted using self-organizing z-association strategies, an SUS 
infomantic technology not slated for public release until Series 
Fourteen or later. SUS spokesnode <no-cumbersome-wires>, 
while adopting a neutral stance on the question, promised a full 
investigation into the matter...

...researchers at McMurdo Sound Institute of Intellics are reporting 
unexpectedly high amounts of yttrium, erbium and other rare-earth 
elements found in recent Mt. Erebus isotopic abundances. Not 
only are these elements in themselves key to the proper 
functioning of long-haul fiber-optic broadband networks around 
the Earth and up into low orbit, but the exotic material xenotime 
and its related analogs are usually found in conjunction with 
them...

*10:25 ET* ... hearing predictions of "huge" xenotime deposits in the 
Erebus strata, which are driving SUS stock higher. Could be the 
most staggering momentum play since Monadic Networks back in 
`09...

*10:34 ET *... JPL paring its losses as Xerox Palo Alto Research Center 
head Brian Scott is announced as new interim chief-intellics-
officer. He's promising an investors' conference later today to 
address lingering political/technological concerns about the ailing 
space exploration company, saying that PARC's proven expertise 
will be at JPL's full disposal...

...a Pentagon defense-readiness summary leaked moments ago to 
an Australian extreme-sports journalist cites supplies of obscure 
mineral `xenotime' as `key' to any `successful' military 
engagement with the Soron Delegation. UN Secretary Delos 
denounced this as the latest example of what she called `a festering 
rhetoric of confrontation' in the Pentagon's troubled relationship 
with the Delegation. Pentagon officials are not available for 
comment...defense stocks are already under extreme selling 
pressure: Martin-Marinetti, Anomalous Atomics, Herovit Human 
Psychometrics, Lovelace Clinics, WhyNot Genomics, Cyto 
BioSystems to name just the worst hit. DoD procurement futures 
already down over 35%. Now-traders are dumping anything with

its alarming low of just half an hour ago... The European Union 
announces adoption of the BeIt! interface for its registered sex 
workers. Recent FDA approval of BeIt!'s latest wireless brainstem-
access upgrade cited as decisive factor. In response, the Euro is 
making an impressive move on the dollar, and the long-term bond

Nasdaq market-maker Merrill Satcom to be indicted by Securities

online attendance... Keynote speaker refuses to answer questions 
after his speech... analytic translations starting to come in now... 
workers at Brookhaven claim there was `a momentary burst of 
what looked like cancelled defense projects of the early 1960s', but 
CNBS commentators are saying this is customary, even traditional 
among some of the human-interface techs from the Delegation, 
pointing instead to the unusual chemical traces monitored in the 
air of the audience hall during the short presentation. Neuro-
affective projections of the possible effects of these should be 
online momentarily...

... informal `poster sessions' open at the Forward Vision Festival... 
several papers on marshalling and otherwise manipulating 
neurotransmitter macromolecules in a neuro-encodement context 
are getting a lot of buzz. The papers are claiming certain strange 
results involving the perception of time... Reached just moments 
ago in her comfort tank, session moderator <of-what-you-call-the-

reports...

...no sooner have Earth physicists and chemists accepted the 
possibility of neurotempic analogs of xenotime compounds as 
suggested at Forward Vision, than an SUS mineral-prospecting 
satellite now reports "the telltale inner union" between its sensitive 
ExoIII  onboard active-sensing dna and the upcoming cycle of 
major planetary alignments. According to SUS, this indicates the  
presence of these compounds several hundred feet below the 
TransAntarctic mountain range... Stocks of several polar-orbit 
satellite launch-providers and arctic mining companies are already 
up over 60% on this news...

government litigation filed just moments ago}... According to the 
press-release: "The hypersonic single- stage-to-orbit ascent craft 
can be on-site at any identified deposits. And within another 24, 
the purified xenotime can be online in the trans-Kenya and trans-
Galapagos pipelines." McMurdo Antarctic Mining Project agreed 
to donate "all available resources" if requested. SUS acknowledges 
McAMP's offer, but feels compelled to assume the enormous risks 
itself...

*13:54 ET ...Dow +377, Nasdaq +518, EXI +511, BGX +215, GDX

are calling for "an annunciation of astounding alternity" (whatever 
that might mean!) "any time real soon now". We're on record 
disagreeing with MMM numerous times in the past. But now? I'm 
not so sure...

*13:57 ET ...Dow +713, Nasdaq +673, EXI +538, BGX +366, GDX 
+1402...* ...an unofficial update to the Human Genome database 
clearinghouse raising a few eyebrows... seems that there are 
dormant sequences in human dna which code for neuro-receptors 
for a class of psychedelic tryptamine-analogs which are found in 
nature only in the pituatary glands of coelocanths. SUS directed-
evolution projections of the sequences show a `vastly illuminated 
region of the future of our life-wave', should these quiet genes be 
selectively activated... What open-ended and ecstatic neural 
embrace between human kind and this ancient, noble fish does this 
indicate? Who cares -- the race is on for an economically efficient 
way to harvest these suddenly very valuable neuro-
macromolecules... just buy anything in the following sectors: bio-
therapeutics simulators, coelocanth gene hot-houses, VLA-
compliant forward parse agents, macromolecular assemblers, 
neuroinformatics, mimsim pharmaceuticals...

*14:00 ET ...Dow +814, Nasdaq +733, EXI +531, BGX +442, GDX 
+1862...* ....these neurotransmitters polymerize into long chains, 
then fold up (like other proteins) into intricate shapes. But unlike 
most others, these are unpredictable even to the new protein-
folding theories that were developed in the early years of this 
century. And they contain these elaborate bucky-ball cages which 
harbour small numbers of individual molecules of xenotime. 
Resting there, recumbent in their vaulted gothic chambers, no one 
knows what these do.... 

*14:07 ET ...Dow +819, Nasdaq +739, EXI +521, BGX +462, GDX 
+1872...* The update has been traced to an SUS-contractor in 
Madagascar. The Soron Delegation has assured us that the 
contractor was not acting on behalf of the Delegation, and will be 
thoroughly disciplined. Spokesnode <my-telemetric-neuroscope> 
says that the data has already been removed.

*14:10 ET ...Dow +830, Nasdaq +844, EXI +534, BGX +512, GDX 
+2155...* seems that when introduced in pharmaceutical quantities 
past the blood-brain barrier, the stuff has some very strange effects 
on human cognition...Early focus groups exposed to the 
neurotransmitters in exploratory concentrations reported "seeing 
the emergent waves of time" and "feeling the pulsing possibilities 
of all the futures", according to one study... ...now seeing reports 
on amateur genome breeding channels that the data was 
downloaded to several mirror sites before it was deleted from the 
HG database.

*14:14 ET ...Dow +866, Nasdaq +927, EXI +544, BGX +618, GDX 
+2634..* . ...specially-bred coelocanth dna designed to be compliant 
with the  neuroinformetric interfaces outlined in the supposedly 
deleted research is already available online... no name yet on the 
colocanth neurotransmitter extract. Some tongue-in-cheek 
possibilities we've heard include sybilinine, sky-dreaminase,and 
chronorphin... Radical breeding enthusiasts are predicting 
digestion timepoints easily maintained in the presence of 
komaramycin, a little-known tryptamine restriction enzyme 
recently approved for 8-base intron cutters, such as those 
commonly used by amateur breeders, and known to be present in 
the neural chemistry of over 30% of the general population. 
Basically, this means that these hot-house fish will be high on their 
brain's own psychedelics for virtually every hour of their life. A 
single fish, their models are predicting, will secrete several 
hundred liters of the stuff over an average lifespan... 

*14:18 ET ...Dow +203, Nasdaq +942, EXI +589, BGX +711, GDX 
+3812..* . ...Patent-futures derivatives on the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science exchange are already into a very 
impressive positive-bias. I'll be the first to ask, amid all this 
euphoria, has anyone actually performed the controlled scientific 
experiment to see whether these early claims have any basis in 
reality? Well, no one cares, do they? SUS stock and its shadow 
derivatives are up, up, up...

*14:21 ET ...Dow -148, Nasdaq +839, EXI +658, BGX +824, GDX 
+4838...* a preliminary research filing with the AAAS compliance  
committee claims that when collected together, macroscopic 
amounts of the neurotransmitters form a kind of gooey plastic 
substance. Certain systems, when brought into near physical 
proximity to these blobs, seem to demonstrate anomalous time 
related properties: certain ones have shown what looks to be a 
reversal of time's one-way (poisoned?) arrow (for example, certain 
small-scale unexplainable decreases in entropy) while others have 
shown speed-ups of time (for example, half-lives of radio-isotopes 
technetium and promethium have been greatly reduced)...  ...so 
whether it's as a drug or as a physical substance in the outside 
world, this combination of coelocanth-extract-human-
neurotransmitter and single xenotime molecules promises to 
change everything we thought we knew about time and our 
relationship to it...

Soltec, local-space head of the Soron Delegation, has scheduled a

by the SEC's decision.

attitudes" ... "unless your time is open in the merging of 
experience" ... ...ok, here it comes... "the Delegation has no 
alternative in the complex pulse-topologies of the third optical 
window but to authorize the immediate release-{affect-

soup-{primordial-metaphoric}"

*14:45 ET* ...Huh? We're checking the translations of that last verbal 
complex he used. It's still relatively unknown, despite so-called 
breakthroughs at Brookhaven... Duty linguists at their traffic-
monitoring site have confirmed the presence "of some sort of love-
wave" in the axiom schemes underlying what he said, but also the 
possibility of "sophisticated mimic-variants" that could be 
misleading and invalidating the analytic techniques used in their 
translation... Whatever the details, Soltec seems to be saying he 
will not co-operate with the SEC, and will make the legal 
alternatives publically available... But you don't care, do you? If 
it's SUS, buy it, no matter the cost. Am I just some lone voice of 
caution? ... echoing now in this remarkable resonance-cavity that I 
have apparently just won from SUS? (OK, now how do I work this
